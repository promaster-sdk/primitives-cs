The the code is provided as-is without support. It is possible to get support by separate agreement with (Divid Promaster AB)[https://promaster.se].

## Property values and filtering

When working with products that have many variants it is helpful to think of each variant as a combination of properties instead of an article number. In this library the properties are represented by a set of name/value pairs in the PropertyValueSet type. This set of properties can then be checked against a filter represented by the PropertyFilter type.

## Unit of measure (uom)

Extensible unit of measure conversion.
